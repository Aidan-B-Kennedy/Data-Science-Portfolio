    "# Sales Forecasting With Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to demnostrate applied machine learning in the retail domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: Walmart launched an initative to crowd source machine learning models that could be used to forecast store sales. Walmart provided historical sales data, down to the department level, for 45 stores located in different regions. In addition, Walmart included promotional markdown event data. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Walmart requested models prioritize forecasting accuracy during these markdown events despite comlete or ideal historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Predict the department-wide weekly sales for each store while prioritizing weeks with holiday markdown events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action: The following documnention reflects the process I followed to create a machine learning model that forecasts sales. "
