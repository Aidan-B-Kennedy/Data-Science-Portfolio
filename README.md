#### The R portfolio is located [here](https://rpubs.com/Aidan_K/).

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents
- ### SQL
	- [Class Actions & Brokerage History](https://github.com/Aidan-B-Kennedy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Class%20Actions%20%26%20Brokerage%20History.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/sajal2692/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 
- ### Natural Language Processing
	- [3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
	- [Cross language Information Retrieval](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Cross%20Language%20Information%20Retrieval.ipynb): Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.
	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_
